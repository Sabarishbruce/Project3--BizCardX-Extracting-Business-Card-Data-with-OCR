# EasyOCR
EasyOCR, is a Python package that allows computer vision developers to effortlessly perform Optical Character Recognition. It is a font-dependent printed character reader based on a template matching algorithm. It has been designed to read any kind of short text part numbers, serial numbers, expiry dates, manufacturing dates, lot codes, printed on labels or directly on parts. EasyOCR currently supports 80+ languages. We need to tell EasyOCR which language we want to read. EasyOCR can read multiple languages at the same time but they have to be compatible with each other.
